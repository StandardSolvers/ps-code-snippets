## Code Conventions and Housekeeping
- None of these is essential for a pull request, but they will all help.  They can also be
added after the original pull request but before a merge.

- Make sure all new `.java` files have a Javadoc class comment with at least an `@author` tag identifying you, and preferably at least a paragraph on what the class is for. 
- Add yourself as an `@author` to the `.java` files that you modify substantially (more than cosmetic changes).
- Add some Javadocs.
- A few unit tests would help a lot as well -- someone has to do it.
- If no-one else is using your branch, please rebase it against the current main branch (or other target branch in the project).
- When writing a commit message please follow [these conventions](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
